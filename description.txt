Users can generate multiple short URLs.

Once the user logs in, he should be able to see the list of short URLs he has generated.   

Must do,

Push your code to a repository in Github. 

Host your application somewhere(Heroku, Netlify or something that you know) 
and then it should be accessible through the browser by a URL.
